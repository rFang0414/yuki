				Bilibili (stylized as bilibili, Chinese: 哔哩哔哩; pinyin: bīlībīlī) is a video sharing website themed around anime, manga, and game fandom based in China, where users can submit, view, and add commentary subtitles on videos. This website uses Adobe Flash Video and HTML5 technology to display user submitted videos hosted by third-party sources, while featuring a real-time overlaying subtitle system for interactive playback experience.
				Inspired by similar video sharing websites Nico Nico Douga and AcFun, the founder of Bilibili, Xu Yi (Chinese: 徐逸; pinyin: xúyì,known as "⑨bishi" on the internet), created a prototype website named Mikufans.cn after college graduation in three days. He relaunched the website in January 25, 2010 with the name Bilibili.[1] Later in 2011, he founded a startup, Hangzhou Huandian Technology,[2] to manage the development and operation of Bilibili.
